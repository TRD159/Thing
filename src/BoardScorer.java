/*TODO:
 * 1. Create 11 Arraylists: 2 sets of five, one for each player, counting doubles, triples, quadruples, and quintuples, and one for useless garbage
 * 2. Implement a system to scan the board and categorize each and every piece into one of these Arraylists
 * 3. Score the contents of each Arraylist according to their priority, and make sure that Craig knows the difference between them.
